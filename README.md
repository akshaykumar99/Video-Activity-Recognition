# Video-Activity-Recognition
Recognize human video activities using Deep learning. This application is useful in wide range of applications such as video surveillance, video content analysis etc.

## Dataset :
I have trained the model on 6 different classes of human actions (walking, jogging, running, boxing, hand waving and hand clapping).
You can download the dataset from here:

* [Walking](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/walking.zip)
* [Jogging](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/jogging.zip)
* [Running](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/running.zip)
* [Boxing](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/boxing.zip)
* [Handwaving](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/handwaving.zip)
* [Handclapping](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/handclapping.zip)

In boxing dataset following file is corrupted **'person01_boxing_d4_uncomp.avi'**, delete it before proceeding.
